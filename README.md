# Student Directory #

The Student Directory script allows you to manage a list of students enrolled at Cartoons Academy.   

I created it as a challenge during week 3 of the Makers Academy precourse. It's been a fun project to do and mostly consolidated the knowledge I already had, but it also introduced some new concepts.   

I especially enjoyed building file-saving and loading methods, as well as filtering methods, and refactoring the code for clarity. The last exercise on writing our own quine (a script that reads its own source code) was also quite exhilarating, even though it was rather simple.

## How to use: ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

or, for using the program as a Command Line app:  

```shell
ruby directory.rb Cartoons_Academy_Students.csv
```
